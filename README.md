# Drainage Design Toolbox
This tool has been designed for two purposes:
- Calculating dimensions of secondary and tertiary drainage system (slope, width, depth) 
- Checking connectivity of the drainage system compared with existing drainage system and landslide risk

The first use of this toolbox is in the refugee camps near Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh. 
The tool is developed by Arnold van 't Veld (DSSWater - Nelen & Schuurmans) in collaboration with UNHCR, WFP and IOM and is now open to use for other humanitarian contexts.

Please use this tool for your purpose and share your issues and improvements on this platform.
